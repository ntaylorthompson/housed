Mailer#host_thank_you

<%= @greeting %>, 

I'd like to thank you for hosting <%= @user.name %> yesterday. We're creating a new way to support and enjoy music, and hope that artists like <%= @user.name.first %> will soon be able to use our platform to streamline the business aspects of their work and focus on the music. This will never be possible without you!

I'd love to hear your thoughts on what worked and what didn't about the experience - we're keen to learn from both and really appreciate any insight you can throw our way. 

And, finally, we judge our success by the answer to this question: would you like to host a show again sometime in the next year? 

YES NO

Thanks again for your support, and I hope to hear from you soon. 

Sincerely, 

N. Taylor Thompson
