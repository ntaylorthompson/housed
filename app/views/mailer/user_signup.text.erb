Welcome to Housed! 

I am thrilled that you've decided to join us on our mission to bring better music to more people. I believe that we can build a new music ecosystem around house shows that helps to streamline the business of music, and lets you and others focus more on the art. 

We're very early on our road and have decided to launch now with a basic website and improve it based on what you and other musicians want, rather than to try and guess at what we should build and launch with something more advanced. So please, PLEASE be in touch! Tell me what works, what doesn't, and what you'd like to see next. 

I look forward to hearing from you! 

Sincerely, 

N. Taylor Thompson
