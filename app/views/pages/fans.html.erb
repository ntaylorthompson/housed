<h1>For Fans</h1><br><br>
<h3>Our vision for fans</h3>
Our goal is to make it easier for fans to find and enjoy live music. We want to create a music ecosystem that revolves around house shows as a performance venue, allowing a more intimate connection with musicians that lets you enjoy their music more. We are building our platform to do three things: (1) make it easy to find musicians, (2) create cultural knowledge for house shows to become more accessible, and (3) allow fans to find local shows through their social networks and musical tastes.<br>


<br><h3>How it works now</h3><br>
In our alpha release, hosts invite their friends to a show. We generate a page for every show that highlights the musician, provides show details, and lets fans buy tickets. Fans can also sign up for our beta release - to be among the first users to search shows in their city and schedule shows of their own. <br>

<br><h3>How it will work</h3><br>
<ul><b>•Sign up.</b> Browse shows available to attend and musicians available to host based on geography, date, and your musical preferences.</ul>
<ul><b>•Customize alerts.</b> Customize how much you want to hear from us - receive email or Facebook alerts when musicians are available near you, or when you travel.</ul>
<ul><b>•Screen through Facebook.</b> When fans search for shows, you'll only be able to see shows that have a mutual Facebook friend who's going. This minimizes sketch for hosts and ensures you'll always have someone interesting to meet.</ul>
